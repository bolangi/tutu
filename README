Tutu - A skimpy outfit for Dancer 

Tutu is a flat-file CMS inspired by Blosxom.  Pages are
created as textfiles, typically formatted with Markdown.
Tutu is based on the Dancer web framework.
 
Tutu is configured as a website to display pages and to
distribute text and media files for training course. It
requires login, authenticated users may upload and download
files.

You may want to remove those capabilities if you don't need
them. In fact, with everything available by streaming
nowadays, it may be considered quaint to expect lay people
to be able to download files.
