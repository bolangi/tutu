Tutu - A skimpy outfit for Dancer 

Tutu is a simple flat-file CMS app inspired by Blosxom.  It
is based on the Dancer web framework and Pages are coded as
markdown.

It is configured as I originally designed it--a website to 
support training programs. It requires login, and it
permits authenticated users to upload and download files.

You may want to remove those capabilities if you don't need
them. In fact, with everything available by streaming
nowadays, it may be considered quaint to expect lay people
to be able to download files, let alone understand what that
means.
