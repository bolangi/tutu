If you have a file to upload to the group, you can use
[this form](/upload.html).

You will may want to choose a section from the 
radiobutton list. (The default is to the uploads/
directory.)

Then you select the file from *your computer's drive*.

To help people use your file, please add a few words
in the *Description* field saying what your file
is about.  [ TODO ]

After choosing the file you may press the
**Start Upload** button. 

There is no progress indicator, so please wait, especially for long files.
(You may notice the network activity from the blinking lights
on your modem as the file is transferred.)


####Legality

Just a reminder to upload legal and sufficiently approved material only. Ask me if you have any questions.
