# How to download and use materials from our website

## Basic concepts: files

Whether text, audio, video or other, the materials on this
website are stored as *files.*, made up of sectors of data
written on to magnetic discs. In general, you must transfer
these files to your computer in order to use them.

A file has a name and contains information. Transferring
files to your computer from another is commonly called
"downloading."

You can download files using a *web browser* such as Firefox,
Safari, or Internet Explorer. That is the program you are using to
load and read this page!

To download from our website, first choose the appropriate page
(video, audio, etc.) by clicking on navigation bar items at the
left  (under the photograph.)

The page will show the names and sizes of the media files.
The files names on the page are called *links*, are
indicated by a special color, and point to the actual files,
like a finger can point to the moon. 

## What to download - collections are the easiest

Assuming you have a good internet connection, the easiest
way to download many files (for example all audio recordings
for a segment) is to choose to download archives with names
like "segment1-audio-recordings.zip" rather than the individual
recordings.

Often, clicking on the link will cause your browser to begin
to download the file. To download a large collection may
take several hours.

After downloading to your desktop or Downloads folder,
to expand the contents of a zip file it's often sufficient
to double-click on the file icon. You may also decompress
them using programs such as StuffIt, PKzip, or Winzip.

that will show that the file is downloading. 

# Viewing/Playing the materials

When the download is finished, you may be able open the file (i.e.
view or listen) by simply **double-clicking** the file icon. Your
computer will decide what program to use for which kind of file.

Double clicking on the file icon is also the usual way to unpack
